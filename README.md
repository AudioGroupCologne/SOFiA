# SOFiA - Sound Field Analysis Toolbox for Matlab

Welcome to the SOFiA sound analysis toolbox 2011-2017, Mayor Release II 2013

Spherical microphone arrays and sound field decomposition using spherical harmonics have recently come into the focus of interest for the analysis of sound fields, room acoustics or spatial audio recording applications. For this purpose, SOFiA has been developed and implemented. It comprises various functions for the analysis of sound fields using data from spherical microphone arrays. SOFiA is designed for MATLAB and consists of native m-functions and externals (called cores) written in C/C++ yielding an efficient and consistent processing chain. The toolbox is released under MIT license.

## Package Information

The full package consists of three Folders:

1. SOFiA Main software (include this DIR to the MATLAB searchpath)
2. APPLICATION_EXAMPLES - SOFiA application examples for MAC and Windows PC 32/64bit
3. ARRAY_DATASETS - Real microphone array datasets mandatory for the Toolbox (add to MATLAB          searchpath)

Update 2017:
The maintainance of the MATLAB toolbox was discontinued in 2013. It can still be used but there is no further development.

The Python successor "SOFiA py" can be found at: https://github.com/QULab/sound_field_analysis-py
